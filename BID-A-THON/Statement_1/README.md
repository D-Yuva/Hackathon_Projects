MATLAB-Based Country Population and GDP Visualization
Objective: Create a MATLAB program to visualize the population and GDP data of various countries.
Design a MATLAB program that takes population and GDP data for a list of countries and generates visualizations, such as bar charts and pie charts, to compare the data.
Your task is to:
1. Input Data: Collect population and GDP data for multiple countries (e.g, from a CSV or manually inputted data).
2. Data Preprocessing: Organize the data into a usable format for analysis (e.g., a matrix or table).
3. Visualization: Create bar charts to compare population sizes and GDP values for each country.
4. Analysis: Create pie charts to show the distribution of total global GDP or population by country.
This simple project helps visualize the economic and demographic disparities between countries using basic plotting functions in MATLAB.
